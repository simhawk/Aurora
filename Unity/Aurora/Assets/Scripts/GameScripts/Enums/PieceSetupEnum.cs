/*  Better Settlers will never have adjacent same resource hexes and will never 
    have more than 11 pips in a three-hex intersection and as far as I can tell 
    you won't get a resource port matched with the same resource hex if that hex 
    has 5, 6, 8, or 9.

    I like using Better Settlers with any group that has a new players in it. 
    But for a round with all experienced players, we'll make it completely random. 
    I enjoy analyzing resource scarcity and using port trading strategies if the same
    resource is clumped together and its subsequent port is accessible.
